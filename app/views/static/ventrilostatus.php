        This example PHP script came with a file called ventriloreadme.txt and should
        be read if you are having problems making these scripts function properly.

        In it's current state this script is not usable. You MUST read the
        ventriloreadme.txt file if you do not know what needs to be changed.

        The location of the 'ventrilo_status' program must be accessible from
        PHP and what ever HTTP server you are using. This can be effected by
        PHP safemode and other factors. The placement, access rights and ownership
        of the file it self is your responsibility. Change to fit your needs.
